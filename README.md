# Fira for Powerline

## About
This repository hosts a modified version of [Fira Mono](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/), which has been modified for Powerline usage. Fira Mono works wonderfully as a coding typeface; these patched versions allow it to function properly when used with Powerline in Vim (see screenshot below for an example).
